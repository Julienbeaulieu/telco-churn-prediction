# Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Rmotr.com Final Project 

## Description
One key business metric that is important to focus on is customer churn or customer attrition. This is because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

This analysis focuses on the most important characteristics of Teleco's customers who are more likely to leave the platform. After exploring the data, we will use some predictive analytics techniques to determine the customers who are most likely to churn in the last month.

In turn, these kinds of models would be able to generate small prioritized lists of customers that are likely to churn. We can then proactively target them with marketing and sales programs and re engage with them to increase the chances that they stay. 

## Scope of the project
The data for this project was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

- Visualize some of the customer features and their relationship with churn. 
- Processing, encoding and normalizing the data into numerical features to use machine learning. 
- Understand which features are the most correlated with customer churn
- Use predictive models to determine the customers that are the most likely to churn.
